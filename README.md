# Final fullstack project
This is a fullstack project with front and back. The backend is made with nodeJS 
and the frontend with REACT.
It implements user verification and authentication with JSON web token;
it makes use of UI libraries, amongst them styled Components and sweetAlert, emotion and MUI.
It implements a mapping and coordinate system to show the approximate location for the properties, making
use of 'leaflet' to show maps with markers, taking advantage of the familiarity.
